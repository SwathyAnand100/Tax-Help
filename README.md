# Tax-Help
This project was developed as a package for the subject “Database Design”. We have developed an application similar to an income tax management system. The idea behind this project is to create an application that 
is more user-friendly. It is to ease up the task of users filling large income tax forms. We have used the concept of Relational Database modelling and have provided a web based UI made with the help of HTML and CSS languages. The database used to store the data is MySQL and PHP has been used for server-scripting.
